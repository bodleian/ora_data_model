ISSUES
Can't set citation _place_of_publication from place-of-publication if value else location since citation _place_of_publication canlt have a conditional within it. Limitation of crosswalk.
Device /Product - map to new subtype 'Device/Product' when available, post release development. (GitHub #158)

#To note

Will crosswalk any external identifiers to Hyrax with a new type - check. e.g. abcd:1234 -><identifier type="abcd">1234</identifier>-->
